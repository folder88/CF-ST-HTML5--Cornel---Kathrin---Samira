    <h1>Set fire to the rain</h1>
    <p>
        <div>I let it fall, my heart</div>
        <div>And as it fell, you rose to claim it</div>
        <div>It was dark and I was over</div>
        <div>Until you kissed my lips and you saved me</div>
    </p>
    <p>
        <div>My hands, they're strong</div>
        <div>But my knees were far too weak</div>
        <div>To stand in your arms</div>
        <div>Without falling to your feet</div>  
    </p>
    <p>
        <div>But there's a side to you</div>
        <div>That I never knew, never knew</div>
        <div>All the things you'd say</div>
        <div>They were never true, never true</div>
        <div>And the games you play</div>
        <div>You would always win, always win</div>
    </p>
    <p>
        <div>But I set fire to the rain</div>
        <div>Watched it pour as I touched your face</div>
        <div>Well, it burned while I cried</div>
        <div>Cause I heard it screaming out your name</div>
        <div>Your name</div>
    </p>
    <p>
        <div>When I lay with you</div>
        <div>I could stay there</div>
        <div>Close my eyes</div>
        <div>Feel you here forever</div>
        <div> You and me together, nothing gets better</div>
    </p>
    <p>
        <div>'Cause there's a side to you</div>
        <div>That I never knew, never knew</div>
        <div>That I never knew, never knew</div>
        <div> All the things you'd say</div>
        <div>They were never true</div>
    </p>
