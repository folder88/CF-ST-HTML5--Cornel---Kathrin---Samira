        What you got under here? Now remember, according to my theory you interfered with with your parent's first meeting. They don't meet, they don't fall in love, they won't get married and they wont have kids. That's why your older brother's disappeared from
        that photograph. Your sister will follow and unless you repair the damages, you will be next. About 30 years, it's a nice round number. Don't worry, I'll take care of the lightning, you take care of your pop. By the way, what happened today, did
        he ask her out? Mother, with Marty's parents out of town, don't you think he oughta spend the night, after all, Dad almost killed him with the car.

        Here you go, lady. There's a quarter. I think you got the wrong car, McFly. Hey, hey, Doc, where are you? That's right, he's gonna be mayor. That's true, Marty, I think you should spend the night. I think you're our responsibility.

        Are you sure about this storm? About 30 years, it's a nice round number. Yeah, well history is gonna change. Hey George, buddy, hey, I've been looking all over for you. You remember me, the guy who saved your life the other day. But you're good, Marty,
        you're really good. And this audition tape of your is great, you gotta send it in to the record company. It's like Doc's always saying.

        Ah. Whoa. And he could sleep in my room. You don't understand. Well, now we gotta sneak this back into my laboratory, we've gotta get you home. Uh, I think so.

        I'm writing this down, this is good stuff. I, I don't know. The car, Dad, I mean He wrecked it, totaled it. I needed that car tomorrow night, Dad, I mean do you have any idea how important this was, do you have any clue? Okay. Well, because George, nice
        girls get angry when guys take advantage of them.

        Hey Biff, check out this guy's life preserver, dork thinks he's gonna drown. Let him go, Biff, you're drunk. I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available at every corner drug store, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by. Marty, I'm sorry, but I'm
        afraid you're stuck here. Without any sugar. Nah, I just don't think I'm cut out for music
    </p>
    <div>div four</div>

        Who? Yeah, I'll keep that in mind. Alright, I'm ready. Whoa, they really cleaned this place up, looks brand new. It's a board with wheels.

        Look at the time, you've got less than 4 minutes, please hurry. Well gee, I don't know. What, I don't get what happened. Marty, is that you? Now, Biff, um, can I assume that your insurance is gonna pay for the damage?
