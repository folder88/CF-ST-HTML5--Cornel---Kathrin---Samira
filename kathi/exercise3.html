                Okay, alright, Saturday is good, Saturday's good, I could spend a week in 1955. I could hang out, you could show me around. Stand tall, boy, have some respect for yourself. Don't you know that if you let people walk all over you know, they'll be walking all over you for the rest of your life? Listen to me, do you think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house? Yeah, I guessed you're a sailor, aren't you, that's why you wear that life preserver. Mom, is that you? Uh Doc, uh no. No, don't be silly.

Hey, Doc, we better back up, we don't have enough roads to get up to 88. A block passed Maple, that's John F. Kennedy Drive.

This Saturday night, mostly clear, with some scattered clouds. Lows in the upper forties. Hey McFly, what do you think you're doing. Are you sure about this storm?

            delorean. Uh, look me up when you get there.

                What Lorraine, what? Marty, that's completely out of the question, you must not leave this house. you must not see anybody or talk to anybody. Anything you do could have serious repercussions on future events. Do you understand? Doc, look, all we need is a little plutonium. There, there, now, just relax. You've been asleep for almost nine hours now. I think we need a rematch.
